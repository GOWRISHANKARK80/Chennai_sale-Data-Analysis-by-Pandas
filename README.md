That sounds interesting! Using machine learning to analyze house sales data in Chennai can provide valuable insights into property trends, price predictions, and the factors influencing house values in different areas. If you’ve already performed some analysis using **Pandas** and ML techniques, I assume you've gathered data such as location, area size, number of rooms, amenities, proximity to key landmarks, etc.

Here’s a potential outline of steps you might have followed, or could consider to improve your analysis further:

  1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - **Data Loading**: Import the dataset using Pandas.
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     data = pd.read_csv("house_sales_chennai.csv")
     ```
   
   - **Data Cleaning**: Check for missing values or incorrect data.
     ```python
     data.isnull().sum()  # Check for missing values
     data = data.dropna()  # Or impute missing values based on the context
     ```

   - **Feature Engineering**: Create or transform features like age of property, price per square foot, etc.
   - **Categorical Encoding**: If there are categorical features like location, you can encode them using `pd.get_dummies()` or `LabelEncoder`.

  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
     **Correlation Analysis**: Understand how features correlate with the target variable (house price).
     **Visualizations**: Create plots to visualize trends, such as:
     - Price distribution by location
     - Price vs. area size


  4. **Machine Learning Modeling**

     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
     y = data['price']
     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
     ```
